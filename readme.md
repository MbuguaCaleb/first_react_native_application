**First React Native Application**

```

It is very similar to react Js but instead of Using react Dom, i return special components from react native that can be rendered into native
applications such as android or IOS.

These includes Views, and Text..

```

**Some Disadavatages of React Native**

```
(a) I sometimes have to change bits of my code depending on the Platform that i am running my Code...

    Goodthing there is a work around to this...


(b)It is very fast moving....some modules are constantly being updated so you must keep growing yourself..
